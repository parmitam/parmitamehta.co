		<h3> About Me </h3>
        My name is Parmita Mehta. <p>I am a software engineer with a decade and half of experience in the IT world. I have witnessed, in this  past decade and a half, the world getting smaller, more connected and also, paradoxically, isolated.
I am also a woman, a mother and a first generation immigrant. With one foot in the first world nation I live and have called my home for almost two decades and the other foot in the distant land that I was born in.
<p> I paint and garden, Pacific-northwest being the most forgiving of environments for an amatuer gardner.
<br>
I love to read and sometimes, write. 

These pages are my opinions, shaped by my experiences. <p>You can reach me at parmitam@hotmail.com.
