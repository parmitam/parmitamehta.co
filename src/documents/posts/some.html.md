I am at the edge of a change, no, not that kind of a change, I not quite 45 yet. Another kind, where I am looking at what I do for a living and what do I expect out of it in addition to keeping a roof on my head, bread on my table and my daughter in expensive private school. The kind of contemplation that should start when one is done with the raising of kids and happens at the same time as the empty nest syndrome. When people who were running around like headless chickens from work to home to pick up the kids to buy groceries to cooking the meal to feeding to cleaning and back to running to drop off the kids and being late for work meetings... wake up one morning at 55 with kids gone and nothing to rush to anymore. I do things ahead of my time, so I guess, I entered the vanprastha earlier too :)

Back to, what do I do, what does it give me? what do I look for in a job? what would I love to do? When I come upon this article in slate.

It is about the joys owning a charming neighborhood cafe. And i start dreaming ....

The small cafe connects to the fantasy of throwing a perpetual dinner party, and it cuts deeper all the way to Barbie tea sets than any other capitalist urge.

It can't be that hard to make money off coffee, the trail blazed by starbucks has gotten people used to expensive coffee ... An espresso that required about 18 cents worth of beans (and we used very good beans) was sold for $2.50 with nary an eyebrow raised on either side of the counter. A dab of milk froth or a splash of hot water transformed the drink into a macchiato or an Americano, respectively, and raised the price to $3. The house brew too cold to be sold for $1 a cup was chilled further and reborn at $2.50 a cup as iced coffee, a drink whose appeal I do not even pretend to grasp.


Just when I was being lulled by a vision of cozy life with no hurry mornings , where I could take the time to chat and make coffee, here it comes the reality check. with numbers, Budgeting $15 for the payroll for every hour your charming cafe is open (let's say 10 hours a day) relieves you of $4,500 a month. That gives you another $4,500 a month for rent and $6,300 to stock up on product. It also means that to come up with the total needed $18K of revenue per month, you will need to sell that product at an average of a 300 percent markup.

I don't have a marriage to fear for, but apparently, it can have detrimental effects on one...Two highly educated professionals with artistic aspirations have just put themselves or, as we saw it, each other on $8-per-hour jobs slinging coffee. After four more months, we grew suspicious of each other's motives, obsessively kept track of each other's contributions to the cause ("You worked three days last week!"), and generally waltzed on the edge of divorce.

but the coup de grâce was the quote from the bad boy chef Anthony Bourdain "The most dangerous species of owner ... is the one who gets into the business for love."

That seals it, the only reason I would go into a business would be for the love of it ... essentially making it a bad proposition. Where did the entrepreneurial skills of my immigrant grandpa go I wonder, they haven't been handed to me.

So another day and another dream squashed. But tomorrow's another day, and I am sure I'll find an occupation which will allow me to bring world peace, or utilize my sabre tongue to write some scathing reviews... while allowing me to make the six figure salary that I do right now...
