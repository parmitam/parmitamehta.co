I worked for a large software corporation for 15 years. And then I quit.  It was a little bit of a jolt to the system, like giving up coffee after a decade of long Starbucks habit. Quitting required untangling, which was not just careful logistical details but also, as I learnt, courage.

The quitting process took a little longer than elephant’s gestation period, for me.  I did wake up one morning and decide today is the day, but that moment was preceded by a lot of days of waking up with a vague sense of unease. Job mobility in Seattle is not as high as in Silicon Valley. As Zuckerberg recounted, from his conversation with Bezos in 2010, the average time someone stays in job at Seattle is twice as long as it is in Silicon Valley. Still, Seattle is no longer a two horse town for techies. A lot of Silicon Valley darlings are opening shop here. The startup community is flourishing as well. Options for those seeking change, abound. As I learnt, it was not the options that were a problem.
<p>
A successful change needs, as I learned, three things. <strong>‘Knowing your why’, ‘Doing your research’ and ‘Being patient’</strong>.
<p>

<p class='lead'> Knowing your why </p> The vague sense of unease, of wanting a change, needs to be distilled into root cause, the reason for change. It is harder than it sounds. If you don’t know your ‘why’, it will be hard to filter where you apply, what you accept and later, how to keep at it when things get tough. More money and varied experience are the most often quoted reasons for a job change. Spend sometime on finding the 'why'. In talking to colleagues who have successfully made the change, the differntiator was the degree of clarity they had on why they switched. I have heard of reasons as subjective as a disliking a boss, to as amorphous as not feeling challenged. Being honest with yourself is important, if you got more money would you stick with this boss? Do you dislike your boss or Do you dislike the lack of autonomy in your current job? Is there a way to change your current circumstance to the fix the deficiency? For me, an good test has always been toask myslef, <em>is  there a way to ensure, the deficiency of the current job, would not recur at the new job?</em> After all, it is very hard to ensure that your next boss is perfect :). I have found, it is better to have objective reasons, like gaining specific experience or a particular skillset. 

<p class='lead'>Doing your research</p> Doing your research follows from knowing your 'why'. There are several sites that can help you with research, depending upon your goal. Glassdoor.com, Salary.com and even Quora, will help you get started with the most common questions about Job descriptions, Culture, Compensation etc. Once you have narrowed down the candidate companies, reach out to your network, do you know anyone who works in these places? Take some time to ask questions to see if working for a company would really satisfy your 'why'. With your short list of candidate companies, it is time to prepare for your interview. For me, rusty as I was, after having stayed in the same place for so long, one of the more brilliant pieces of advice was, to first interview with a company that was not on the top of my short list. The practice was good, and the others followed.

<p class='lead'> Being Patient</p>Once you have made the switch, it is time to be patient. Change is hard, preparation for change is relatively easy, and the flurry of activities makes time go by much faster. No matter how thoughtfully you have made this decision, when it comes down to the transition, it is going to be hard. Something about change triggers our basic survival instinct, when predictability disappears, so does safety, at least, that is what it feels like.  This is when rebounds and ricochets happen. To go through this period of change, you need to focus back on the 'why'. Knowing, this is hard, helps. First few months in a new place, are going to be hectic. After all of the prep work for landing the job, you'll need a break. Take some time off before, you start at the new job. It has always served me well.

<p>Your first few months will be spent ramping up, remember to space learning, with doing. This would not be a problem if you are going to a smaller company or startup from a larger company. The important thing here is to balance. Allocate time for learning; be in charge of your time rather than the environment driving your time.  Balance the learning, with contributing to the team, to the business. Spend time to network. In a new place you will need a new network, from people who can tell you how the coffee machine and copier work, to folks who will tell you how to get things done here. Most of all remember, why you wanted to change, every time it gets hard, take deep breath and go back to this 'why'. 
<p>
And in time, you will realize that you have made a successful switch.
