I worked for a large software corporation for 15 years. And then I quit.  It was a little bit of a jolt to the system, like giving up coffee after a decade of long Starbucks habit. Quitting required untangling, which was not just careful logistical details but also, as I learnt, courage.

The quitting process took a little longer than elephant’s gestation period, for me.  I did wake up one morning and decide today is the day, but that moment was preceded by a lot of days of waking up with a vague sense of unease. Job mobility in Seattle is not as high as in Silicon Valley. As Zuckerberg recounted, from his conversation with Bezos in 2010, the average time someone stays in job at Seattle is twice as long as it is in Silicon Valley. Still Seattle is no longer a two horse town for techies, a lot of Silicon Valley darlings are opening shop here. The startup community is flourishing as well. Options for those seeking to change abound. As I learnt, it was not the options that were a problem.
<p>
A successful change needs three things. <b>‘Knowing your why’, ‘Doing your research’ and ‘Being patient’</b>.
<p>

<p class='lead'> Knowing your why </p>. The vague sense of unease, of wanting a change, needs to be distilled into root cause, the reason for change.   If you don’t know your ‘why’, it will be hard to filter where you apply, what you accept and later, how to keep at it when things get tough. More money and varied experience are the most often quoted reasons for a job change. Real reasons could be as subjective as a disliking a boss. Be honest with yourself, if you got more money would you stick with this boss? Do you dislike your boss or you dislike the lack of autonomy in your current job? Ask yourself if there is a way for you to ensure that the current circumstance would not recur at the new job? It is very hard to ensure that your next boss is perfect. It is better to have objecting reasons, clear definition of responsibilities and degree of autonomy; these are easier to look for as part of a company’s culture.

<p class='lead'>Doing your research</p>. Doing your research follows from knowing your why. There are several sites that can help you with research, depending upon what your goal is. Glassdoor.com, salary.com and even Quora will help you get started with the most common questions about job descriptions, culture, compensation etc. Once you have narrowed down the candidate companies, reach out to your network, do you know anyone who works in these places, take some time to ask questions to see if working for a company would really satisfy your why. With your short list of candidate companies, it is time to prepare for your interview. For me, rusty as I was after having stayed in the same place for so long, one of the more brilliant pieces of advice was, to first interview with a company that I was not on the top of my short list. The practice was good, and the others followed.
<p>
<p class='lead'> Being Patient</p>.Once you have made the switch, it is time to be patient. Change is hard, preparation for change is relatively easy, and the flurry of activities makes time go by much faster. No matter how thoughtfully you have made this decision, when it comes down to the transition, it is going to be hard. Something about change triggers our basic survival instinct, when predictability disappears, so does safety, or at least that is what it feels like.  This is when rebounds and ricochets happen. To go thru this period of change, you need to focus back on the why you changed. Knowing it is going to be hard helps. Remember you need a little time to mourn; mourn before you start the new job. Take some time off before you start at the new job.

<p>Your first few months will be spent ramping up, but remember to space learning with doing. This would not be a problem if you are going to a smaller company or startup from a larger company. The important thing here is to balance. Allocate time for learning; be in charge of your time rather than the environment driving your time.  Balance the learning with contributing to the team, to the business. Spend time to network. In a new place you will need a new network, from people who can tell you how the coffee machine and copier work, to folks who will tell you how to get things done here. Most of all remember, why you wanted to change, every time it gets hard, take deep breath and go back to this why.
<p>
And in time, you will realize that you have made a successful switch.
