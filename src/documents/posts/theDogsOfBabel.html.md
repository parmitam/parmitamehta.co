"Had I known but yesterday what I know today, I'd have taken out your two grey eyes and put in eyes of clay.And had I known but yesterday you'd be no more my own, I'd have taken out your heart of flesh and put in one of Stone." Says the Elf queen to Tam Lin, when Janet brings him back to the mortal land, or so the myth goes.

Carolyn Parkhurst has written an amazing story, delving into the lives of Paul and Lexy and Lorelei, the Rhodesian Ridgeback. Understanding how the words of elf queen were said in love and not revenge is perhaps a clue to the understanding Lexy and her strange but touching love story. It is a tale of love and despair and imperfections of the mortal being and his demons. The two characters are depicted with such tenderness, empathy and honesty ( without stooping to soppy sentimentality)that they will forever be etched in my mind.
Beautifully written, it reminds how the story is told matters as much as the story.
