City of Djinns is a book about Delhi, and its impressions left on young Mr Dalrymple. Djinns, being spirits of fire that inhabit the world with us, humans. In this book, he traces the remains of the eight cities that were built on land known as Delhi. From Indraprastha to Lutyens Delhi. He peels back the layers from the most recent to the ancient. The narrative is an engaging mix of the day to day debacles of existence of a white man in Delhi, the landlady, the taxi driver, the maid; interspersed with the historical and archeological findings. The book is livened by the interviews. The batty old British ladies, living relics of the British occupation of India; The professor who teaches about the days of Mughals and their art; the folks who inhabit the periphery of the society - the Hijras, being most notable.<p>
The book includes delightful illustrations of scenes from Delhi by Mr Dalrymple's wife. My Dalrymple's pre-occupation with the Mughal period and the twilight (the period between fall of Mughals after Aurangzeb's accession and British supremacy following 1857 revolt), leads to him spending more time on these periods than the other phases of Delhi. The older periods receive mere mentions, one seems to feel the running out of steam.<p>
They say, to be able to write well, you need an objective view of the subject. William Dalrymple defies that wisdom-- he loves Delhi and is no objective bystander. Perhaps, it is this connection, this love for the city that makes this volume much closer to the city and elicits such emotion from the reader, than the tomes published by learned researchers.
