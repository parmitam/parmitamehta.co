<br>


This is Ms Malladi's second book I read. I found it a major improvement over the 'A Breath of Fresh Air', her first novel. The protagonist is an American born Desi, Devi, who tries to commit suicide in the first few pages-- after she is saved from death ( much to her chagrin) by her mom, she stops talking and starts cooking.
<br>
The book interspersed with fusion recipes and letters (that characters of the book write to each other but never send ). It is an un-impassioned depiction of the lives of the women from three generations; grandmother, mother and daughters -- how they influence each other and how despite the incompatible values and incomprehension of motives ( and sometimes hatred) there is an undercurrent of love. The book is well written with compassion and wit. There are no neatly tied ends only a glimpse into the lives and minds of these women, their fears, their hopes and dreams. Nicely done!
