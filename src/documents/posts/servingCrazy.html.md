This is Ms Malladi's second book, I read. I found it a big improvement over, 'A Breath of Fresh Air', her first novel. The protagonist, is an American born Desi, Devi. Devi tries to commit suicide, in the first few pages. After she is saved from death, much to her chagrin, by her mom, she stops talking and starts cooking.
<p>
The book interspersed with fusion recipes and letters. Letters, that characters of the book write to each other but never send. It is an un-impassioned depiction of the lives of the women from three generations; grandmother, mother and daughters. How they influence each other, and how despite the incompatible values and incomprehension of motives ( and sometimes hatred) there is an undercurrent of love. The book is  written with compassion and wit. There are no neatly tied ends only a glimpse into the lives and minds of these women, their fears, their hopes and dreams. Nicely done!
