Sacred Games is tome of War and Peace proportions, it is not a hurried read. It is very dense, replete with philosophy and the very detailed Hindi epithets. 
<p>
Sartaj Singh and Ganesh Gaitonde; pieces of the story read like a Hindi movie. The insets, small stories in stories - about peripheral characters, are amazing in their details. I can justify the seven years, it took to write this book. Vikram chandra, despite the cops and robbers story, writes with great compassion and lack of judgment about characters ranging from black to light gray. 
<p>
Not for the faint of heart though, it is long and  sometimes, tedious read, book with too many, characters and connections. It is unparalleled in its depiction of the seedy underbelly of the Filmi duniya and the 'religious affiliations' of the politicians, more depth and details of a world that I have never known, but now seem to understand. A very satisfying journey.
