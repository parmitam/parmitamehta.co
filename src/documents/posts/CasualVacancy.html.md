<p>
JK Rowling is a difficult writer to read. It sounded like blasphemy, when the thought first formed in my head. The hours spend with Harry Potter, the first of which were read by my daughter when she was 7, were in direct conflict with that errant thought.  Casual Vacancy is JKR’s first  attempt at adult fiction.  It follows the events in a little town in England, after a town council member’s seat comes open after his sudden death.

The book is hard to read. It has too many characters. Barry Fairbrother, the dead man’s life revolved around  Pageford, the town, the school,  the Parish council and the rowing crew he put together at St Thomas. The thread of the lives is hard to pick up, too many names and not enough context. The social worker from London and her beautiful daughter, the Dursley-ish  Howard  and Shirley Mollinsons, the town GP, Parminder Jwanda and her tormented daughter, Roark inspired Fats and his troubled parents, and Krystal and Terri Weedon. It starts to feel like a great collection of flawed characters, but a story, that doesn’t move.

The last third of the book is the payout for staying with the Dickensian pace. The characters are more than two dimensional shadows that inhabit most books  by then. The motivations and the final collision make as much sense as life, but atleast, you are walking in the town square, rather than looking at a cartoon strip with your morning coffee.
<p>
Maybe it is the hyper paced world we inhabit that make Pageford’s life and people slow, and boring; maybe  it is the too many people, some of whom you never needed to know to read about  to understand what happens; maybe we are used to being talked down to, given predigested fare that hits the spot faster. If what you remember of the book, or how long it stays with you,  is the true measure of a book- it might not be a bad book at all.
