<p>
This was a completely surreal journey- the woman in the red vinyl hat defies imagination. After a long day at work this book truly takes you to a strange land. A land with blurry edges -- the moves from reality, to dream, to reality -- with your body as the sole evidence is the pinnacle of suspense, or is it? Did it happen or did he dream it? You, as a reader ask this again and again. It is true, in story telling, what is not said is just as important as what is, but there is far too much left to the reader interpretation in this book for it to be a satisfying read. <p>The book ends and you are not quite sure what hit you.<p>
The characters are endearingly crazy, from <em>Malta Kano</em> to the <em>Ginger cat</em> who starts all this trouble :)<p>
It is well written, with a somewhat unusual combination of detailed description and inspired insight. It is frustrating read for someone who wants a tale well told; for this is a tale, with characters well imagined.<br>
