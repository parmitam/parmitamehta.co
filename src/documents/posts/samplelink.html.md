[Dave Winer][1] has some interesting thoughts on the reality of attaching your future to an API like Twitter's. It has always surprised me the number of applications that were being build completely tied to a companies future that was not yet established. 

>Twitter had been telling developers, for years, that they should develop all kinds of clients. That was when Twitter was just a website and had no clients of its own.

>Smart developers will not just conclude that Twitter is unsafe to build on, but also any company that is operating in the Twitter model. If they are running a website, and trying to attract a lot of users, and are going in the direction of advertising, you'd be a fool to think they won't do the same as Twitter has.

Of course Twitter is not alone here, they just happen to be the a recent big organization that changed their direction regarding APIs. Nothing new, we should not act so surprised.
