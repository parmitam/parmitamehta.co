This seemingly simple book starts with a description of a daily life, like any other contemporary mainstream novel. The first thing that strikes me as I read thru the book was the almost obsessive-compulsive use of certain generic words ( like carer and donor) -- as if they meant something specific. At this point I turned to the back to see if the book was a translation that would explain this, maybe. But it was not. And this is where I think the genius of the book lies, somehow in the repetition, slowly but surely ( almost Pavlovian) Ishiguro changes the world as we know it- now the words and nuances are not just paranoid interpretation, they are significant as you learn more about guardians and possible.
By the time it comes to you, you are prepared, but it does not dilute the impact. It is chilling in Orwellian way.
It is a love story - coming of age tale in a twisted time. Maybe we will live to see this day-I hope not.
One of the best stories I have read in a long while.
