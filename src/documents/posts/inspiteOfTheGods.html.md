10 pages into the book I was in tears. This is a description of the modern India. The bundle of contradictions that is India. The conflict between the potential and slow moving reality brings you to tears. Ed Luce focuses on the 2004 -2006 as the present but traces back the influence of British and Mughals and the rise of the Hindu nationalism. It is written with compassion and understanding. It is not another one of the many books that go into a trance about ancient Hindu culture and its spiritual heritage. He calls out all the problems- illiteracy, poverty, lack of infrastructure, inadequate health care, callus attitude towards the environment, high unemployment , rampant corruption the great dichotomy in the society as presented by the urban and rural segment to the political influence from Nehru and Bapu to Lallu and Manmohan.

Perhaps the most comprehensive and deeply felt descriptions of Modern India and the challenges facing it!
