<br>Hey!
<br>Hey yourself, how have you been!
<br>Good, which floor?
<br>Four. It's been crazy busy.
<br>Yeah, I checked in the watson stuff last friday. 30,000 crashes in one bucket...
<br>Wow!
<br>Yeah, all because a of missing curly brace in a format string.
<br>OMG... really?
<br>uh-huh.

It was not until I was in my office and was checking my email that I realized what a supremely geeky conversation I had in the elevator. And I didn't think anything of it. Yuck... I have become such a nerd.
