Hey!
Hey yourself, how have you been!
Good, which floor?
Four. It's been crazy busy.
Yeah, I checked in the watson stuff last friday. 30,000 crashes in one bucket...
Wow!
Yeah, all because a of missing curly brace in a format string.
OMG... really?
uh-huh.
It was not until I was in my office and was checking my email that I realized what a supremely geeky conversation I had in the elevator. And I didn't think anything of it. Yuck... I have become such a nerd.
