Interesting and a somewhat chilling account of what happened in Iraq. The book is written very well, reads like a story, author's wry sense of humor permeates the narrative. The details take over the tale, but the overall picture if one takes a step back to consider - is scary-- it really happened!<br>
Reminds me of the adage- ' good intentions do not sanitize bad impact' and this was terrible impact!
